1. What question are you trying to answer?
The primary question I am trying to answer whether Amazon products have declined in quality over time(or at least if the tone of reviews has become more negative). I want to see if this varies by location or by product type/category. I would also like to analyze the reviews over time particularly changes in review length, volume, and average popularity(number of "helpful" votes).

3. Why is this question worth answering? This can be either because it has some personal value to you or because it is a question that others are asking. If it is a question others are asking, then provide an example.
I hear a lot online about how product quality has gone down in attempts to be cheaper or sell more. I want use this information to make better purchasing decisions or at least understand how I can identify better products. I believe with a growing anti-consumerism movement, people frequently discuss declining quality due to capitalism on Reddit and social media.

5. What is your hypothesis? Why leads you towards that hypothesis?
I hypothesize that Amazon product reviews have become more negative over time, at least in perceived product quality. I expect to observe a decrease in average star ratings, an increase in the frequency of negative sentiment in written reviews, and possible changes in review length and engagement. I am curious to see if there are significant differences by country. 

6. What is the primary dataset(s) you will use to answer the question? The dataset(s) must be at least 15GB in their original form when downloaded. Provide links. You may not choose r/place (any year) as your analysis set.
